Developing a tool to help easy identification of knick points on stream profiles and corresponding map. See gif below for example.

Input files were generated by [LSDTopoTools](https://github.com/LSDtopotools) [(Mudd et al., 2014)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract), input data is structured around outputs from .csv and .tree files from those scripts.
